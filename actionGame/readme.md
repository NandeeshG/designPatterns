# actionGame
## Requirements:
1. A FPS game, with multiple characters (Soldier, Chief, King, Bigfoot).
2. Each character can have one weapon at a time. Require ability to change weapon at runtime
3. Each weapon has fire(), reload(), draw(), store() methods
4. Characters can walk() and jump()
5. Make it Expandable to add more characters and weapons in the future

## Solution:
1. We will use strategy pattern:
```The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.```
2. Solution in design phase right now...
